# Code Validation 

## W3C HTML Validation Results

All HTML code has been run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

<details>
<summary> W3C HTML Errors Found and fixed</summary>


</details>

After testing all errors were fixed and document checking complete was shown for all pages

![document checking complete](documentation/testing-images/document-ok.png "")

## W3C CSS Validation Results

All custom CSS has been run through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "jigsaw w3 page")

No errors were found when running CSS through w3c validator

## Responsiveness testing

| -------- | ---------- | --------------- | -----------| ------- |
| Samsung22 Ultra | Tested site on mobile | Site functions and is responsive | Worked as expected | N/A |
| iPhone 15 | Tested site on mobile | Site functions and is responsive | Worked as expected | N/A |
| Dev Tools for iPad | Tested site for iPad Pro via dev tools | Site functions and is responsive | Worked as expected | N/A |

## Browser Compatibility

The site was tested on the following browser types

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari

## User Testing

A user testing form was sent to friends and family to test the site on their devices and get real world feedback from people who had not been involved in the creation of the site.

Here is the form that was sent.

![user testing image](documentation/testing-images/user-testing-form-tempalate.png "user testing form screenshot")

Feedback from the form

* Better responsiveness for mobile - added media queries after this feedback
* User testing did not throw many errors as users followed instructions
* Users found it easy to add, edit, and delete a swim
* Users found it easy to create an account and navigate the website 

### Things to implement from user testing

* User reported that "I put in a non matching password and it didn't warn me" so password errors were added to form to ensure this cannot happen

* User reported "Had a problem with the time field. Would be good to know the format it was looking for." so placeholder text was added

* User reported "It would be good if errors popped up in a different colour. I entered something incorrectly when creating an account and it took me a second to notice because it was the same colour font" - this would be a good feature for future implementation 

# Accessibility Testing

## Lighthouse

Google Lighthouse test from the dev tools was used to test the pages on the site for 

* Performance
* Accessibility
* Best Practices
* SEO
