# Key Project Goals

The main goal of the site is to offer a one-stop-shop for clients of KMC Projects. This main goal can be split into smaller goals, they include
- Being able to be able to contact KMC Projects and enquire about working with them.
- See what kind of services KMC Projects offer
- Read about case studies to see they type of work they can provide
- Purchase parts from the distribution products list

# Business Model

The business model is both a business-to-customer and business-to-business as they work both with individual professionsals, companies and clients.
For business to customer, the site provides a list of products to purchase, the customer can do this without being a client of KMC Projects and can purchase as a one off item.
For business to business, the site provides business a contact form to get in touch with KMC project in order to work with them from their list of services or ask for a bespoke offering. Businesses can also purchase from the prodcuts page.
Both businesses and customers can create a login in order to see their purchase histroy. 

When speaking with Kevin from KMC Projects he said this business model worked well for them as it allowed a range of people to come and see what they can do. This is called a [Business to Many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_to_many#:~:text=With%20both%20B2B%20and%20B2C,more%20quickly%20on%20the%20market. "Business to many wikipedia") or B2M

## Target Audience

KMC Projects target audience focus on the hydraulic industry, businesses involved in construction, manufacturing, infrastructure development, and related sectors. Their clients often know what they need before coming to the site.
The audience main goals are to
- Contact KMC Project
- Find parts they are already looking for (using part number, or sometimes part name)

# Agile Development

A Kaban board was used in GitHub to create the agile development process â€“ see the board [here](https://github.com/sarahgoodwin93/kmc-projects/projects?query=is%3Aopen Kaban Board)

There were 4 projects created

- Generic User (Guest)

- Regisered User

- Admin User

- Shopper

To represent the 4 different access areas of the site. 
User stories were labelled using the MoSCoW method.

# Web Marketing

For this project the following web marketing strategies were used:

- SEO and content marketing
- Social media marketing
- Email newsletter subscription

## SEO Implementation

To implement SEO in this project, various techniques were used. These include using semantic HTML, avoiding excessive keyword repetition, integrating keywords naturally within website content, incorporating metadata descriptions and keywords at the head level of the project, and using the 'noopener' attribute in the 'rel' tag. External links have descriptive 'aria-label' attributes for enhanced accessibility.

The keywords are short-tailed and long-tailed and are as follows:

Short-tailed Keywords:
 - Hydraulic Design
 - Consultancy
 - Project Management
 - Training
 - Problem-solving
 - Fluid power
 - Engineering
 - Hydraulic Solutions

Long-tailed Keywords:
- Hydraulic Design Excellence
- Hydraulic Consultancy Services
- Project Management for Hydraulic Systems
- Hydraulic Training Programs
- Innovative Hydraulic Solutions
- Precision Hydraulic Engineering
- Efficient Hydraulic Systems
- Expert Hydraulic Engineers
- Hydraulic Product Distribution List
- Quality Hydraulic Products for Purchase

A robots.txt file is included at the project's root level. This file instructs search engine crawlers about the URLs they can access on the website. Its primary purpose is to prevent the site from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. It's important to note that robots.txt isn't intended to exclude web pages from Google; rather, it serves as a tool for managing crawler access.

The project's root level also includes a sitemap.xml file. This file serves as a catalog of a website's crucial pages, ensuring that Google can locate and index them effectively. It aids search engines in comprehending the structure of your website. It's crucial for Google to index all significant pages of your website. However, certain pages may lack internal links, making them challenging for search engines to discover. A sitemap can expedite the process of content discovery in such cases.

## Social Media Marketing

Facebook was used as the primary social media platform for web marketing due to its extensive user base and broad demographic reach. The objective of establishing a Facebook business page is to attract the attention of potential customers and to showcase the company's products and services effectively. A real business facebook account was created and at the time of submission was active it can be found here [KMC Projects Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61558802589438 "KMC Project Facebook page")

![KMC Project Facebook](media/README-images/facebook-img.png "KMC Project Facebook page")

# User Experience

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for each different page type, Home, Services, Products and Forms.
The Products wireframe was used as a base to create the cart & checkout pages.
The forms wireframe was used as a base to create the login, logout, sign up, contact us and newsletter pages.
This was done to keep consistancy across the site. 

Wireframe can be down in these drop downs:
<details>
<summary> Wireframe Home</summary>

![Wireframe Image Home](media/README-images/wireframe-home.png "home wireframe")

</details>

<details>
<summary> Wireframe Services</summary>

![Wireframe Image Services](media/README-images/wireframe-services.png "services wireframe")

</details>

<details>
<summary> Wireframe Items</summary>

![Wireframe Image Products](media/README-images/wireframe-products.png "products wireframe")

</details>

<details>
<summary> Wireframe Forms</summary>

![Wireframe Image](media/README-images/wireframe-forms.png "forms wireframe")

</details>


## Database Schema

The data schema was created using [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/ "drawsql website homepage") before the project was started to get the flow and function of the models.
Some of the fields in the below images do not reflect the final data types used â€“ please see the app for the true data types.

There are 4 custom models in this project
- The Services Model (full CRUD)
- The CaseStudy Model (full CRUD)
- The Contact Model
- The NewsLetterSignUp Model

![Data Schema Image](media/README-images/custom-models.png "custom models")

There are also  models that have been amended from the Boutique Ado Walkthrough to fit the requirements of the site
- The Item Model (based on the Products model)
- The Order Model (based on the Order model)
- The OrderLineItem Model (based on the OrderLineItem model)
- The UserDetials (based on the UserProfile model)

A full data schema was used using `django-extensions` > `pydot` > `python manage.py graph_models -a > all_models.dot` visualising the dot file with [GraphvizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/ "GraphvizOnline website")

![All Data Schema Image](media/README-images/models.png "all models")

## Typography

Proxima Nova was chosen from Adobe Fonts for its clean and elegant design. It is characterized by its rounded strokes and subtle variations in stroke width, giving it a warm and friendly appearance. As the client wanted a clean, minimal and industral look, proxima nova seemed like a perfect fit. 
It suits well with the logo that was already created for the business.  


## Colour Palette

![Color palette Image](media/README-images/colour-pallete.png "colour pallette image")

KMCs hero colour is #f99411, this was taken from their logo which was designed in by [JayKay Art](https://www.jay-kay.co/ "link to jaykay art homepage")

The colour pallet was craeted using the logo and the clients instructions to keep the site minimual and clean.
Different shades of grey were chosen to make the orange stand out and provide a nice contrast while keeping the look industral. 

The colour pallette also allows images added to the site to stand out.

### Logo

![Logo Image](media/README-images/logo-readme.png "image of logo")

The logo was designed in by [JayKay Art](https://www.jay-kay.co/ "link to jaykay art homepage") and was already a part of the KMC Project business. It was the only design assets the client provided and much of the sites looks and feel came from inspriation of the logo. 

Under the logo the tagline 'Hydraulic Design, Consultancy, Project Management & Training' clearly states the key services of the business and the two are often found together.

The favicon is taken from the logo itself.

![Favicon Image](media/README-images/favicon-readme.png "image of favicon")

`if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }`

2. install webserver: `pip3 install gunicorn` - replaces the development server once the app is deployed to Heroku

3. run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` - creates a file to let heroku know which packages to install.

4. Create Procfile file

5. Add this code for Heroku to create web dyno: `web: gunicorn green_planet.wsgi:application`

6. Go to Heroku, settings , config var and add variable:
`COLLECTSTATIC` : 1 ,so that Heroku won't try to collect staticfiles when we deploy.

7. Add the hostname of the Heroku app to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in settings.py

8. Push the code to Github

9. In the terminal run: `heroku git:remote -a heroku-app-name`
